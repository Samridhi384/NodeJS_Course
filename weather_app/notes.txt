the job of call stack is to track the execution of program

in event loop it means that  if call stack is empty then it will run function of callback queue  by passing it into stack

 so event loop waits for the call stack to be empty

 extra 
 and when it's empty, it goes back to check if there are any tasks in  task queue. If yes then it executes them one by one until the task queue becomes empty  before it goes back to listening for events.

Geocoding is the process of transformation of any location name into geographical coordinates, and the other way around (reverse geocoding). 

Direct geocoding converts the specified name of a location or zip/post code into the exact geographical coordinates;
Reverse geocoding converts the geographical coordinates into the names of the nearby locations.
