web socket is a full duplex protocol
here full duplex means that the client can send data to server and also receive data from server at any time that is 2 way communication.

socket.emit is for client
socket.on is for server

`socket.emit` is used to send a message from the client to the server, while `socket.on` is used to listen for and receive messages from the server on the client side.

// socket.emit - Sends data to this individual socket id only
// io.emit- sends data to all connected sockets including the one that sent the message
// socket.broadcast.emit- sends data to everyone but the socket that sent the message

    // io.to.emit- used for specific users or rooms
    // socket.broadcast.to.emit- used for sending to everyone in a room excluding the sender
